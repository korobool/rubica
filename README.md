rubica
======

Fun with rubica-cube for Rouslan. Here you can find simple cubic-rubica model implementation with basic operations
available. 12 rotations, previous state saving by cube copying, cubes comparison (getting diff) and equality checking.

The goal of this model is to make it easy to try application A* algorithm and other AI approaches to cubic rubica
problem.
